# 📱 Learning Flutter

Welcome to my **Flutter learning journey**!  
This repository documents my progress, projects, and resources while learning **Flutter** — Google’s open-source UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for **mobile, web, and desktop** from a single codebase.

## 🎯 Goals
- Master the fundamentals of **Dart programming language**  
- Build responsive and cross-platform UIs with **Flutter Widgets**  
- Learn **State Management** (Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, etc.)  
- Integrate **APIs & Databases** (Firebase, SQLite, REST, GraphQL)  
- Explore **animations, navigation, and performance optimization**  
- Develop **real-world projects** for portfolio building
