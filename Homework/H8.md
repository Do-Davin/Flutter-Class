# 🔑 Key Points
* Use Dart's Random class from dart:math.
* Maintain character pools like:
```dart
const upper = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
const lower = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
const numbers = "0123456789";
const symbols = "!@#\$%^&*()";
```
* Build a master pool depending on user selection.
* Pick random characters until password length is reached.
